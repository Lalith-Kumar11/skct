<h5>“The highest education is that which does not merely give us information</br> but makes our life in harmony with all existence”</h5>
                          -Rabindranath Tagore</br>


The rise of SKCT to prominence over its thirty five years of existence is primarily attributed to its mission to accomplish expectations of the society and industry by nurturing the students to be competent professionals with integrity, besides profound technical knowledge and skill. In rethinking education to deal with rapid changes at the dawn of the twenty-first century, innovation, technology, and research are indispensable tools of education. As we are quite aware, education is central to the knowledge-based society that derives from human potential.</br></br>

“Learning to Be, and Learning: The Treasure Within” have been key sources for education policy makers and practitioners internationally. I invite you to explore the treasure within you through outstanding teaching, choice based credit system, and a wide range of academic programs and extra-curricular offerings which SKCT has. Generations of students, staff, alumni, and parents have built our reputation, and we continue to grow in the eyes of the public. Welcome to SKCT and witness the pathways of learning which leads to the mainstream of the knowledge revolution. Come and confront confidently the challenges that the future holds in store!</br></br>
